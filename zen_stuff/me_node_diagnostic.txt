The "me" node is completely unreachable on the network.

1. **Hostname Resolution Failed**: `ssh: Could not resolve hostname me.local`.
2. **Ping Failed**: Destination Host Unreachable for `10.0.0.30`.
3. **ARP Incomplete**: The MAC address for `10.0.0.30` is showing as `<incomplete>`, meaning the device is not responding to ARP requests.
4. **Service Discovery**: It is not showing up in `avahi-browse`.

This indicates the device is likely **powered off**, **disconnected from the network**, or has **crashed completely**.

Please check the physical device "me":
1. Is it powered on?
2. Is the network cable plugged in (or WiFi connected)?
3. Can you physically reboot it?

Once it's powered back on and connected, I can help verify the services start up correctly.
